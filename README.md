I did this to study and improve my hacks on frontend to get better.

## Get Started 

You can downloand or clone this repo and open all files on your web browser that you wanna. I recomend to use the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/pt-BR/chrome/).
All files are localizate on folder ("capitulos/chapters"), they're separated by chapters folder'n it.
